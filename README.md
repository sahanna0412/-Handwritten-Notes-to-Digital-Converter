This project converts handwritten notes into digital text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and AI-based post-processing techniques to enhance accuracy.


✅ Handwriting Recognition – Extracts text from scanned handwritten notes using Tesseract OCR.
✅ Spell Checking & Correction – Uses NLP-based techniques to fix OCR errors.
✅ Regex-Based Cleanup – Removes common OCR misinterpretations.
✅ Easy-to-Use – Built on Kaggle, making it easy to run without complex setup.
